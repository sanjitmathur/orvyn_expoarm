ORVYN’s Myoelectric ExoHand is an active exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation. It uses EMG sensors to read residual muscle signals and actuate the hand, assisting patients with physiotherapy exercises (gripping, pinching) and daily tasks like holding objects. Designed to bridge the gap between neural intention and physical movement.
